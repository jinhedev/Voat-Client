# Voat

This is the unofficial Voat client for iOS written in Swift.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Mac: You will need the latest Xcode and the Swift 3+.

Linux: I just need to assume you know what you are doing.

### Installing

Voat iOS uses Carthage as package manager. You will need to have Carthage installed. If you need tutorial on Carthage, click here: https://www.raywenderlich.com/109330/carthage-tutorial-getting-started

Step 1 - Navigate to your project directory

```
cd {your-project-directory}
```

Step 2 - Install project dependencies

```
carthage update
```

Step 3 - [optional]

It's up to you to manage and update packages from this point onward. Just drag and drop them into Embeded Binary if you wish to apply updates.

## Versioning
